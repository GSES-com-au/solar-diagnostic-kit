# solar-diagnostics-kit

This project is focused on developing automated fault detection and diagnosis systems for solar panels, leveraging data analysis and machine learning techniques. 
Our repository is divided into two main sections, each housed in its own folder:

## 1. Threshold-Based Detection (`./Threshold-Based_Detection`)
This section is dedicated to the detection of 'level 1 faults' in solar panel systems. These faults are described and detailed within the folder's readme. It includes two main subprojects:
- **Performance Analysis**: Utilizing Jupyter Notebooks, this subproject performs site-level AC data analysis for performance assessment.
- **Labelling Level 1 Faults**: This involves labelling of level 1 faults in AC data, crucial for identifying specific performance-related and raw-signal-related issues.

### Key Features
- Jupyter Notebooks for individual site and all sites analysis.
- Detailed categorization of faults, including performance-related and raw-signal-related.

### Data and Output
- CSV files for sites and monitors, along with labelled data for diagnostics.
- Outputs include individual and aggregate fault data and analysis plots.

## 2. ML & RB Detection Repository (`./ML & RB Detection`)
This section expands on fault detection and diagnosis, both at the AC and DC sides of solar panel systems. 
It encompasses a variety of methods and algorithms for in-depth data analysis.
